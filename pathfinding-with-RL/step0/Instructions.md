# Introduction
### Hello welcome to the first step of your reinforcement learning project. The first thing you need to do for every RL project is to create the environment
### You will have to make an environment (make it a class) and introduce the correct variables.

## Variables
- height and width of environment/map
- starting position (x, y) of agent
- destination/end coordinates (x,y)
- list of actions (can be number coded)
**Feel free to introduce any other variable you deem necessary!**

## Method
- Reset method

⋅⋅⋅Has to reset current position of agent and set the status of whether training was done or not to False
