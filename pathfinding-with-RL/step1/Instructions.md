# In this step, we'll be moving onto the main part of the program.

With your environment now created, you will have to interact with the environment and train the agent.

## Initializing Variables
**We will need to initialize certain variables for your program**
- gamma
- epsilon
- decay
- qtable (a variable containing values for all actions in every possible state)

**All of these variables are explained in the supplementary file**

## Create A Loop
**You'll have to choose an amount as your epoch, which is the amount of times you want to 'train' your agent (your agent finishes an epoch when it reaches the end)**
