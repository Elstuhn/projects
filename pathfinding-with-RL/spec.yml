short-description: A starter project for developers to start developing with Reinforcement Learning
long-description: |
    Your challenge is to make a reinforcement learning program that can traverse any map of any width and height

    This project focuses mostly on your programming skills and logic, the equation will be provided. Any language is allowed.

    Your users should be able to

    - Set the height and width of the map

    - See how the agent traverses the map at the end of training

    - See how fast the agent finishes training and get insight to the agent's development over time

    The `README.md` file will provide further details about the project. The `supplementary.md` file is where you'll find the equations and their explanations

    Don't forget to share your submissions with the community to get feedback. All the best.
